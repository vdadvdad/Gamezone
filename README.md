Made during Hello World 2023 â€” Hackathon for freshmen at Purdue.
## Games
### - Roulette
### - Poker
This works as a classic game of Texas Hold 'em between you and four computers. The game is mostly finished, but doesn't simulate a poker game accurately yet. For one, betting is only set for you, and the computer's don't bet. Secondly, at the end of the hand, I decided to display a perspective from every player - you will see 5 major outputs, all containing the 5 cards from the river and each player's two hands they were dealt. I printed this out so that you can see who actually won that hand based on the river. I intended to make betting a part of the game so that there would be more excitement to it instead of just one hand at a time, but nevertheless, my program does accurately find which hand would have one a round!
### - Blackjack
