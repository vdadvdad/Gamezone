## Games
### - Roulette
Fully founctional version of a rulette. All 7 types of bets are available and validness of input is checked (every check is proven in comments). After the game, displays winning condition and what numbers would've won the game for user.
### - Poker
This works as a classic game of Texas Hold 'em between you and four computers. The game is mostly finished, but doesn't simulate a poker game accurately yet. For one, betting is only set for you, and the computer's don't bet. Secondly, at the end of the hand, I decided to display a perspective from every player - you will see 5 major outputs, all containing the 5 cards from the river and each player's two hands they were dealt. I printed this out so that you can see who actually won that hand based on the river. I intended to make betting a part of the game so that there would be more excitement to it instead of just one hand at a time, but nevertheless, my program does accurately find which hand would have one a round!
